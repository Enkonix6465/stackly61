    <p data-i18n="intro_para">
      Education is a fundamental right and a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty. 
      Yet millions of children are denied access to quality learning due to financial struggles, 
      lack of resources, or social inequalities. 
      <br><br>
      Education for Every Child ensures that young learners receive the knowledge, 
      skills, and opportunities they deserve. From providing books and digital tools 
      to building safe classrooms, we empower children to dream bigger, achieve more, 
      and create brighter futures for themselves and their communities.

      Education is more than academics—it is the foundation for equality, empowerment, and progress. 
      Children who receive quality education are more likely to break free from poverty, 
      lead healthier lives, and contribute positively to society. However, millions still face 
      barriers such as lack of schools, resources, and trained teachers.

    <p style="text-align: justify;" data-i18n="intro2_para2">
      Our mission is to eliminate these barriers by providing school supplies, 
      scholarships, and access to digital learning. Through community partnerships, 
      teacher training, and inclusive classrooms, we are creating environments where 
      every child can thrive and reach their full potential.

        Despite progress, millions of children are still out of school. Poverty, gender inequality, 
        lack of infrastructure, and conflict prevent them from accessing even basic education. 
        Many children who attend school struggle due to overcrowded classrooms, insufficient

        The digital divide is another challenge—without access to technology, rural and underprivileged
